REACT, JS, HTML, CSS, SASS, Responsive Sites, Node.js, Express, internal and external APIs.

###### Data

My data are coming from Google Search of the top cocktails of the world and from CocktailDB API.


###### APIs

I also am using the CocktailDB API . The API and site will always remain free to access at its basic level. If you love our service and want extra features you can sign up as a Patreon supporter for $3. You can cancel anytime. This allows them to pay for the servers and bandwidth and develop new features and content. You can use the test API key "1" during development of your app or for educational use (see test links:https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). However you must sign up to Patreon if you want a production API key if releasing publicly on an appstore.

###### Notes

The site was developed to be reactive and to change the format at three sizes:

less than 786 pixels > then use mobile formatting
between 786 pixels and less than 1280 pixels > then use tablet formatting
more than 1280 pixels > then use desktop formatting

This site is using a backend API that can be checked in the Git repository: https://github.com/drv0228/cocktail-landia-api
